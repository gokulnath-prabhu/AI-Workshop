# Feature Specification: Organize Bus Bookings by Trip Groups

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help me organize bus bookings in separate trip groups. Trips are grouped by travel date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Trips are never inside other nested trips. Within each trip, booked buses are previewed in a tile-like interface."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to organize my bus bookings into separate trip groups based on travel date, so that I can easily manage and view my trips.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a set of bus bookings, **When** I open the main page, **Then** I see trips grouped by travel date, each showing booked buses in a tile-like preview.
2. **Given** multiple trip groups, **When** I drag and drop a trip to a new position, **Then** the order of trips is updated accordingly on the main page.
3. **Given** a trip group, **When** I view its details, **Then** I see all booked buses for that trip in a tile interface.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no trips or bookings? The UI displays an empty state with a clear call-to-action to add a new trip group.
- How does the system handle overlapping travel dates? The system allows multiple trip groups to have the same travel date, but each group is managed independently and visually separated.
- What if a user tries to drag a trip into another trip? The UI prevents this action and provides a tooltip or message indicating that trips cannot be nested.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create and manage trip groups based on travel date.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all booked buses within each trip group in a tile-like interface.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to re-organize trip groups by dragging and dropping them on the main page.
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure that trips cannot be nested within other trips.
- **FR-005**: System MUST update the display order of trips after drag-and-drop actions.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle cases where there are no trips or bookings by displaying an empty state and prompting the user to add a new trip group.
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow multiple trip groups with the same travel date, treating each as a separate group.

### Key Entities
- **Trip Group**: Represents a collection of bus bookings grouped by a specific travel date. Attributes: travel date, list of booked buses, display order.
- **Bus Booking**: Represents a single bus booking within a trip group. Attributes: bus details (e.g., operator, departure, arrival), booking status.
