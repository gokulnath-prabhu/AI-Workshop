# Implementation Plan: Organize Bus Bookings by Trip Groups

**Branch**: `001-build-an-application` | **Date**: 2025-09-11 | **Spec**: /specs/001-build-an-application/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-an-application/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Build a React/Next.js web application to organize bus bookings into trip groups by travel date. Users can drag and drop trips to reorder them. Each trip group previews its booked buses in a tile interface. No authentication or database is required; use in-memory or file-based storage for demo purposes.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript, React 18, Next.js (latest LTS)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React DnD (for drag-and-drop), CSS Modules or styled-components
**Storage**: In-memory (no DB)
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress (for E2E)
**Target Platform**: Web (modern browsers)
**Project Type**: web (frontend only)
**Performance Goals**: Page load <2s, drag-and-drop <100ms response
**Constraints**: No authentication, no persistent DB, must be accessible (WCAG AA)
**Scale/Scope**: Demo scale (single user, 1-100 trips)

## Constitution Check
**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (frontend only)
- Using framework directly? Yes (Next.js, React)
- Single data model? Yes (TripGroup, BusBooking)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (no unnecessary abstractions)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? N/A (single app)
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes (enforced by workflow)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes (no mocks for core logic)
- Integration tests for: drag-and-drop, trip grouping, tile preview
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes (console, browser devtools)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes (user-facing error messages)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Yes (semver in package.json)
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? N/A (demo app)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- No major unknowns. All clarifications resolved in spec. Research best practices for drag-and-drop in Next.js, accessible tile interfaces, and in-memory state management.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- Entities: TripGroup (travel date, buses, order), BusBooking (details, status)
- API contracts: N/A (no backend)
- Contract tests: N/A (frontend only)
- Test scenarios: Drag-and-drop reordering, empty state, tile preview, accessibility
- Quickstart: Steps to run the app, run tests, and validate drag-and-drop

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
- Tasks will be generated from data-model.md, quickstart.md, and test scenarios. TDD order: tests before implementation. Models before UI. Drag-and-drop and tile preview in parallel.

## Complexity Tracking
| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None      |            |                                     |

## Progress Tracking
**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
