# Feature Specification: Allow users to add source and destination location names when creating a trip group, and improve UI spacing

**Feature Branch**: `002-allow-users-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Allow users to add source and destination location names along with the travel date when creating a new trip group. Also, fix the padding and spacing between UI elements for better layout and usability."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to specify the source and destination locations, along with the travel date, when creating a new trip group, so that I can better organize and identify my bus bookings. I also want the interface to have clear and consistent spacing between elements for a more usable and visually appealing experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is on the main trip group creation UI, **When** they create a new trip group, **Then** they MUST be able to enter a source location, a destination location, and select a travel date.
2. **Given** the user has entered source, destination, and date, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the new trip group is created and displayed with the entered details.
3. **Given** the user is interacting with the UI, **When** they view or interact with elements, **Then** the padding and spacing between UI elements MUST be visually consistent and meet usability standards.

### Edge Cases
- If the user leaves the source or destination field empty, the system MUST prevent trip group creation and prompt the user to fill both fields.
- If the user enters a location name longer than 30 characters, the UI MUST truncate the display (with ellipsis) but retain the full value for tooltips or details.
- If the user tries to create a trip group with the same source, destination, and date as an existing group, the system MUST prevent creation and show a friendly message that the trip already exists.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to enter a source location name (required, cannot be empty) when creating a new trip group.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to enter a destination location name (required, cannot be empty) when creating a new trip group.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to select a travel date when creating a new trip group (existing behavior).
- **FR-004**: System MUST display the source, destination, and date for each trip group in the UI.
- **FR-005**: System MUST enforce consistent padding, spacing, and shapes between UI elements according to Material Design guidelines throughout the trip group creation and display interfaces.
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that required fields (source, destination, date) are not empty before allowing trip group creation.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle long location names by truncating display beyond 30 characters with ellipsis, but retain the full value for tooltips or details.
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent creation of duplicate trip groups (same source, destination, and date) and show a friendly message if a duplicate is attempted.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow letters, numbers, and commonly accepted special characters (such as '-', ',', '.') in location names.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TripGroup**: Represents a group of bus bookings for a specific journey. Attributes: source (string, required, 1–30+ chars, allowed chars: letters, numbers, '-', ',', '.'), destination (string, required, 1–30+ chars, allowed chars: letters, numbers, '-', ',', '.'), date (date), bookings (list of BusBooking).
- **BusBooking**: Represents an individual bus booking. Attributes: bus details, passenger info, etc. (unchanged).
