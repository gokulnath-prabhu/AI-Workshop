Stage 1: Basic Rocket Setup

Objective: Create a basic rocket and get it ready for launch.

Requirements:

Rocket Properties: A rocket has a model (e.g., "Explorer-1") and a base_mass (in kg). 25000kg

Fueling: A rocket has a fuel_level (0-100). It must be at 100 to launch.(is in %)

System Check: Create a function to verify_readiness(). It should return true only if the rocket's fuel_level is 100.


Stage 2: Adding Engines

Objective: Equip the rocket with an engine that determines its launch capability.

Requirements:

Engine Types: A rocket must have an engine. Engines add to the rocket's mass and provide lifting power.

Alpha Engine: Adds 5,000 kg mass. Provides 50,000 kg of lift power.

Beta Engine: Adds 10,000 kg mass. Provides 150,000 kg of lift power.

Launch Mass: A rocket now has a launch_mass, which is its base_mass plus its engine's mass.

Launch Sequence: Create a function to start_liftoff().

It must first confirm the rocket is ready.

It must then check if the rocket is light enough for the engine to lift.

If all checks pass, it should initiate the launch sequence and update the rocket's status. Otherwise, it should indicate a failure.
